# Sonic Surf

## Inspiration 💡
Ocean water covers more than 70% — 75% of the Earth. Over the last decade we have become increasingly alarmed at the amount of plastic in our oceans. Sources say **more than [8 million](https://bit.ly/3BtB385) tons** of it ends up in the ocean every year. It's estimated that if pollution grows at this rate, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by *2050*.

Our friend **Blahaj** 🦈 is stranded in the middle of a toxic water body, starving for oxygen just to live. Our primary objective to make sure that it **survives** and in return we'll get our **reward**!

We aim to make both Blahaj's life and Our's better, so the reward is Health Benefits. Thus we came up with SonicSurf ✨

## What it does 🤔
Prolonged screentime can extensively affect our eyes and hence might weaken our vision, or worst can give blindness. Leveraging **eye-tracking**, players can control Blahaj and guide him to safe areas in the ocean by *performing various* **eye-exercises**. Don't worry we aren't forcing you to leave your desk, instead you can vibe through the exercises which will increase bloodflow in your eyes stimulating the production of **Aqueous Humor** (a clear fluid that fills and helps form the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye) that prevents our eyes to dry up, hence keep the moisturization level optimal.

Hence, we prove, **More Screentime ≡ Better Health 👨‍💻**

## What's next for SonicSurf 🚀
Multiplayer-Mode! Yes, we know that you want that, and we won't let you down ;)
Moreover, we aim to improve the experience for low-spec users along with adding in-game transitions for a more beautiful experience!
